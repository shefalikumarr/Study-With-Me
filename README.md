# Study-With-Me

By noticing a pressing need in our Cornell community, we created Study With Me. Study With Me is a web application designed to be an open space to meet peers in similar courses to the user. The intention is to provide an environment to easily facilitate communication between students who wish to talk with others. We want to help bridge the gap and create a service that makes connecting with your peers easier as classmates and friends. Despite being physically apart, we hope to bring our community together.
